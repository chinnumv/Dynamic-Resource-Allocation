# Resource Allocator
## Overview
This Python code implements a simple resource allocator that dynamically adjusts the number of servers based on changing conditions such as user traffic, course popularity, and system load. The aim is to efficiently allocate resources to meet the demands of the system while ensuring optimal performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy library (for random number generation)

## Usage
1. Instantiate Resource Allocator:
Initialize the ResourceAllocator class with the maximum number of servers that can be allocated.
Example:

```
allocator = ResourceAllocator(max_servers=10)
```

2. Allocate Resources:
Call the allocate_resources method of the ResourceAllocator instance with parameters representing the current system conditions: user traffic, course popularity, and system load. This method dynamically adjusts the number of servers and returns the allocated servers.
Example:

```
user_traffic = np.random.randint(1, 100)
course_popularity = np.random.rand()
system_load = np.random.rand()
allocated_servers = allocator.allocate_resources(user_traffic, course_popularity, system_load)
```

3. Output:
The method allocate_resources returns the number of servers allocated based on the provided conditions.
Example:

```
print("Allocated servers:", allocated_servers)
```

## Classes and Methods

1. ResourceAllocator:
- init(max_servers): Constructor method to initialize the resource allocator with the maximum number of servers.
- allocate_resources(user_traffic, course_popularity, system_load): Method to dynamically allocate resources based on the given conditions and return the allocated servers.
- calculate_desired_servers(user_traffic, course_popularity, system_load): Method to calculate the desired number of servers based on the provided conditions.
- adjust_servers(desired_servers): Method to adjust the number of servers based on the desired value.

## Example

An example usage of the resource allocator is provided in the code file. It demonstrates how to initialize the allocator, simulate changing conditions, and dynamically allocate resources based on those conditions.
